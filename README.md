# QurAnki - Quran Memorization App

QurAnki is an elegant mobile application designed to help users memorize the Quran through an adaptive learning system. The app uses a spaced repetition approach, similar to Anki flashcards, but specifically tailored for Quranic memorization.

## Features

-   **Progressive Learning**: Master individual ayahs before combining them into larger sections
-   **Adjustable Difficulty**: Control how many words are blanked using a slider (0-10)
-   **Multiple-Choice Selection**: Tap blanked words and select the correct answer from options
-   **Adaptive Learning**: Words you struggle with stay in the review pool longer
-   **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your memorization progress for each surah
